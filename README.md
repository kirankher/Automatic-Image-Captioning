# Automatic-Image-Captioning
This project implements an automatic image captioning system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for language modeling. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset.
